# network-AI

AI player for the Network board game that stores its own versions of the game board and game pieces and uses a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to defeat its opponents.

Briefly, Network is a two-player game played on an 8x8 grid gameboard. Players take turns placing opposite-colored chips onto the board. The objective is to complete a "network" from one edge of the game board to the opposite edge by forming a sequence of 6 or more chips that are connected to each other along straight lines (either orthogonally or diagonally).

Does not use any external Java packages. All data structures used (hash table, linked lists) were implemented by hand.

Developed as part of a project for the UC Berkeley Data Structures course.
